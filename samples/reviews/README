This directory contains a sample application to demonstrate the use of
BidiChecker. The application has a BiDi bug for BidiChecker to catch.

reviews.html - The sample application.

reviews_packaged_test.html - Sample tests of reviews.js using BidiChecker in its
packaged form. Does not require the Closure Library to run. This demonstrates
the recommended way to use BidiChecker in a typical application.

reviews_closure_test.html - Sample tests using BidiChecker in its non-packaged
form. This demonstrates using BidiChecker in an application based on the Closure
Library. The Closure Library must be installed at its expected location for this
to work; see the BidiChecker User's Guide for more details.

reviews.js - A widget formatting movie title and review data for display in a
localized UI. Contains a bidi bug for BidiChecker to catch.

i18n.js - Quick and dirty internationalization support utilities. Not very
interesting.

minitestrunner.js - A quick and dirty miniature unit test runner. Not very
interesting.
